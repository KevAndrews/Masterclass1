                    Tandoori Chicken - Restaurant is an authentic Indian dining experience. Very handy location on the main street with plenty of parking nearby. Hosts were very warm, friendly and welcoming. The food from the aloo ki tikki starter to the saag and kadhai paneer mains were delicious. Wine menu was pretty decent too. I liked the decor and layout of the restaurant as well.  Will be making regular trips back for sure.

                    This is a very good Indian restaurant. The menu has all the usual favourites you would expect in an Indian restaurant.  The staff are very helpful and friendly especially when you get to know them. There generally is not an issue getting a table but book ahead for groups and at weekends to be sure. It's central location makes it easy to get to.

                    An absolute gem of a place,rediscovered Tandoori Chicken - Restaurant after been a fan when it resided in Newbridge a decade ago. Back a few months ago when Covid hit it was takeaways for majority of it but have dined in too now and the food is up there with best I’ve ever had in an Indian restaurant,every time,staff are great too!
                    Very authentic home style Indian food advertised and that’s exactly what it is.
